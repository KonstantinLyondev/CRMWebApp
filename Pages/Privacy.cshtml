    <p>
        This CRM application collects and processes personal data solely for the
        purpose of providing customer relationship management functionalities.
    </p>

    <h4>What data we collect</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address, username, and password (stored as a secure hash)</li>
        <li>Client information entered by users (name, contacts, company details, addresses)</li>
        <li>Deals and interactions related to clients</li>
        <li>Security and audit logs (who performed which action and when)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How we use your data</h4>
    <p>
        The data is used to provide CRM features such as managing clients, tracking deals,
        logging interactions, and ensuring application security. We do not sell or share data
        with third parties, except when required by law or for hosting/email delivery providers
        under strict contractual guarantees.
    </p>

    <h4>Data storage</h4>
    <p>
        Data is stored in Microsoft SQL Server. It remains available as long as your account
        is active. If you delete your account, your data will be erased or anonymized within
        a reasonable timeframe.
    </p>

    <h4>User rights</h4>
    <p>
        You have the right to request access, correction, deletion (“right to be forgotten”),
        restriction, objection, and data portability. You can manage part of this directly
        from your account (Personal Data page).
    </p>

    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>
        Passwords are stored using strong hashing algorithms. All communication is protected
        by HTTPS. Access to functionality is strictly controlled through user roles (Admin/User).
    </p>

    <h4>Changes</h4>
    <p>
        This policy may be updated. Significant updates will be communicated to users
        within the application.
